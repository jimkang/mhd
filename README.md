And Bad Mistakes, I've Made a Few
=================================

This was a project I did for [Music Hack Day](http://new.musichackday.org/) [2013](http://blog.echonest.com/post/66776489063/the-echo-nests-5th-music-hack-day-boston-was-a). It takes a song and makes random beats in it the wrong pitch, using [remix.js](https://echonest.github.io/remix/javascript.html).
